      <h2>Facebook for Business</h2>
      <p>Facebook for Business gives the latest news, tips and best practices for using Facebook to help meet business goals. The team approached Sequence to rebrand and redesign the network of sites that create Facebook for Business (FB4B). My role on the project was as Interaction Designer, this involved combining the separate sites, and creating the foundation for the new atomic design system.</p>

        <h6>Problem</h6>
        <p>FB4B websites were difficult to navigate, and users were failing to find their product and services they were searching for. The site felt dated, and did not properly reflect the mission and identity of FB4B.
          <div class="problem">
            <p> Designing a consumer facing site that serves as the landing for the majority of Facebook's income was an amazing opportunity. Major issues such as globalization and localization serious information architecture.

          <h6>Vision Piece</h6>
          <p>Because of the sheer number of stakeholders involved in this project, it became very important to advocate for the necessity of this redesign. In order to promote the rebrand and web redesign, and showcase the benefits of this project, a beautiful Vision Piece was desgined. I helped create many of the assets on the pages as well as all the mobile versions of the piece.
            <div class="problem">
              <p>Unfortunately this piece cannot be displayed on this site. For more details about the final product please get in touch!

        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Information Architecture</h6>
          <p>In order to create a central site where all FB4B businesses could be found, it was necessary to combine many of the smaller microsites. The large network of sites and wikis that make up the entire FB4B site needed to be accessible through one navigation system. This iterative process resulted in a very simplified version of the site architecture. </p>
          <div class="problem">
            <p>This part of the project was particularly tricky. Explaining the reasons for merging the smaller microsites to all stakeholders was a challenging but rewarding part of the redesign.

        </div>
        <div class="constraints">
          <h6>Design System</h6>
          <p>Decided to use an atomic design system so that it would be easy to use to spread the large quantity of pages. Would be impossible to design each page, but making the main ones and identifying reusable elements was realistic. Also help FB developers create content. Also because site needed to be updated continuously.</p>

          <h6>Wireframe</h6>
          <p>Gives a whole new meaning to wireframe, create skeletons of major pages on site, or pages where we would see the most unique elements. Created a library of the elements (atoms) and modules (molecules), and began creating a draft guideline for page structure and hierarchy. Worked directly with FB4B stakeholders to identidy important information from the site as well as identify mandatory elements. </p>
          <div class="problem">
            <p>Because I was continuously iterating over these hand drawn wireframes, instead of redrawing each page after a worksession, I broke the pages down into movable parts and used photoshop to draw out full scale wireframes that could be printed, transported and presented very easily.</p>

            <h6>Time out</h6>
            <p>Unfortunately, this project was too big to complete within my internship, and I had to hand-off my work part way through. While I cannot share much more, I can say that this was one of the largest projects I have had the opportunity to take part in. Not only is it amazing to design for such a large audience, but due to Facebook's reach, design problems such as accessibility, globalization, etc. came into play.</p>
